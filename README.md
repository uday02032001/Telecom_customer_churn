Customer Churn Analysis Dashboard – Power BI Project
Project Overview
This project aims to analyze customer churn behavior using a telecom dataset and visualize key trends with a dynamic Power BI dashboard. The goal is to help stakeholders understand why customers leave and what can be done to retain them.

Dataset
Source: Telco Customer Churn Dataset (7043 records)

Features: Demographics, subscription details, service usage, contract types, tenure, payment methods, and churn status.

Key Insights
Churn Rate: Last month's churn rate was 27%, with 1869 customers leaving out of 7043.

Contract & Tenure: Customers with monthly contracts and low tenure are more likely to churn.

Demographics: Customers without partners or dependents show higher churn likelihood.

Internet Service: Customers using Fiber Optic have a significantly higher churn rate.

Senior Citizens: Surprisingly, senior citizens churn less than non-seniors.

Add-On Services: Lack of Tech Support, Online Security, and Device Protection correlates with dissatisfaction and churn.

Recommendations
Contract Restructuring: Introduce 3- or 6-month contract options to reduce early-stage churn.

Service Bundling: Add essential services (Tech Support, Security, Protection) to standard plans to enhance customer value and satisfaction.
